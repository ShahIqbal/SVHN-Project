# SVHN-Project

Despite its high dependence on GPU and ambiguity of
the Black Box hidden layers, most of the recently published
papers are based on how good deep neural networks
are performing. However, less complex machine learning
algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest are overlooked
as their performances are considered to be inferior(LeCun,
Yann, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton 2015). In our
paper, we will apply simple but still powerful Machine
Learning algorithm baselines for performing the same tasks
performed in the paper Dropout: a simple way to prevent
neural networks from overfitting.(Srivastava, Nitish, et al
2014) and aim to attain similar or better performance by
extensive hyperparameter tuning of these algorithms.
